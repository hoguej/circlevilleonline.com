CIRCLEVILLE - On Saturday, April 20th, the Pickaway County Family YMCA held its first ever adult dodgeball tournament at its facility at 440 Nicholas Drive. Eight teams signed up to play with about 40 total players. Each team played 3 round robin games, then played in a single elimination tournament. Lance & Friends took first place, Ball Busters took 2nd, and the winners of the consolation bracket were The Monsters.

Pickaway County Family YMCA Director Jeff Phillips said, “We have been thinking about it for a long time. We’re about getting people here and having fun. We thought dodgeball would be a fun thing to do.” He said that when they decided to do the tournament, a group of staffers volunteered and really took control of the planning and drove the event. Many staff members were at the event, either organizing, refereeing, or participating on teams.

Phillips added, “I think the teams that came had a good time. We learned a lot from this. Hopefully, if we advertise it again, people will say, ‘Hey, we heard it was a really good time.’ To me, I think we’d do it as much as the community wanted us to.”

Roosters was the presenting sponsor. They provided prizes to the winning teams and discounts at their restaurant to each of the participants. Healthcare Logistics donated the first place plaque.

Before the tournament, one of the players jokingly boasted, “When we win this tournament, we’re going to hang this plaque at the YMCA with our pictures above it.” His team ended up winning first place, so the next time you’re at the YMCA, see if he was able to get it displayed. On the way out, one of the players exclaimed to Phillips, “Definitely do it again next year. That was a lot of fun!”
