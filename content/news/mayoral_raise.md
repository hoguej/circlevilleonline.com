## The Lie

The lie goes, mayoral candidate Tom Spring pushed for a big pay raise for the Mayor position (alone), then cut fire and police positions, then ran for mayor in order to collect on that pay raise. The deception continues that the incumbent Mayor Don McIlroy stood alone against the pay raise in an altruistic stance to protect the budget. It’s also implied that the pay increases contributed to the laying off of firemen and policemen.

## The Truth

According to the Herald, McIlroy said, “I’m in favor and, Tom, I’m 100 percent behind you that we should be paying our top person in the city $100,000. It needs to be a city manager, not so much a mayor. In my opinion that’s what we should be concentrating on. If we’re going to make a change, let’s be knowledgeable and make the right change, and that right change to me is to a charter city where we could get that CEO that you’re talking about.” The mayoral candidates disagree on specifics, but according to this quote, they agree that the top leader of the city should be making 6 figures.

The timing of the claim doesn’t line up, either. Nobody knew in October, November of 2018 that in March, the city would be cutting fire and police. If anybody knew by December 2018 when the resolution was finally passed, it would have been the auditor and mayor, but that information was not presented to council as part of the pay discussion. The auditor and mayor propose budgets, and they would have started working on that budget by late 2018 or early 2019.

The pay increases are set to come into play in 2020 and beyond; therefore, they have no impact on the 2019 budget. In addition, the pay increases will be offset by other reductions in expenses, such as paying off the fire house. Finally, the pay raise wasn’t just for the mayor position; the two ordinances included raises for city council president, auditor, treasurer, law director and council members. Pay raises for elected officials had absolutely no impact on the 2019 budget and did not contribute to fire and police budget cuts, or any other cuts in 2019 for that matter.

The implication is also that Spring voted himself a pay raise. That’s simply not true. There’s no guarantee that Spring will become mayor; however, most of the incumbents winning other positions will benefit from the pay increase that they helped enact. All members of council, [voted for council's increase](https://www.circlevilleherald.com/news/city-council-votes-to-increase-elected-official-salaries-excluding-mayor/article_f6413279-0bad-5a20-893e-003595ef9df9.html) except for Councilperson Katie Logan Hedges, who is also running for at-large in they May primary. But here's the dirty little secret. Every legislature in the land legislates their own pay increases. It's the legislatures job to manage the purse, included the wages of elected officials. There's nothing unusual going on here.

Although the mayor mentions that even a small increase in elected wages will impact the budget, that doesn’t appear to be his only objection to avoiding the pay raise. According to a [December 12, 2018 story on the subject by the Circleville Herald](https://www.circlevilleherald.com/news/city-council-to-consider-mayor-s-pay-raise-again/article_53e982fb-c7a8-52a3-8a1c-ba07bbfe3512.html?fbclid=IwAR1KirZ9fizces05Li5zStrcNCB29F-HgYkvyImh71cnDQVuTSfTpfM4sZg), Mayor McIlroy is in favor of paying the “CEO of the city” $100,000, not the $52,000 that would take effect in 2021. The Mayor preferred that the increased salary be paid to a city manager, not the mayor; however.

The fact is, the pay raises were on the books well before candidate applications were due, in order to achieve their goal to attract as much competition for those positions as possible. If Spring or other councilpersons were executing a secret sinister plan to give themselves a pay raise, you’d think they would pass the ordinance as close as possible to the filing deadline to reduce the chance of competition and increase the chance of receiving the pay increase without challenge.

In fact, the opposite happened.  [According to a quote reported in the Herald, Circleville City Council President David Crawford said](https://www.circlevilleherald.com/news/city-council-approves-raise-for-next-mayor/article_1ae826eb-dee7-5601-b45d-48aac3d0c224.html?fbclid=IwAR0CrX1DYsCIxxhyFLLB84M6T1I7eYzsFFKKPN1BX6ePguxU2PNOSFK1ask), “This is the first time that I can remember that city council has been able to come up with a slate of elected officials salaries well before the time that petitions are due for the elections. That was your only task and you completed that early and I think I can discharge the committee. Thank you very much.”

## Why would a city in financial turmoil raise political wages at all?

The city’s budget is always in peril. Revenue growth has been stagnant over the last 20 years while inflationary pressures are increasing the cost of running the city. It wasn't common knowledge in late 2018 exactly how dire the budget would be in March 2019. The budget that was later proposed by the mayor was not know to council when they voted on Mayoral pay increase; however, the pay increase didn't impact the 2019 budget any way.

### But why?

Not very many people are running for Circleville City offices.

For 6 positions in the [upcoming May 7th primary](https://pickaway.ohioboe.com/c/BallotProofs.pdf), only 2 are contested. After May 6th, we’ll know how many independent candidates are added to the mix, but that’s still not great. Many positions are filled by candidates that have been serving for many terms, but never challenged. [According to the Herald, Spring said at the time](https://www.circlevilleherald.com/news/city-council-to-consider-mayor-s-pay-raise-again/article_53e982fb-c7a8-52a3-8a1c-ba07bbfe3512.html?fbclid=IwAR1KirZ9fizces05Li5zStrcNCB29F-HgYkvyImh71cnDQVuTSfTpfM4sZg), “If we continue to keep the rate artificially low, we’re going to continue to keep getting what we’ve always gotten or frequently gotten and that is uncompetitive races or landslides.” If it’s true that pay increases attract more candidates, then an obvious conclusion is that keeping pay lower benefits incumbents who have already decided the existing pay is worth it.

## Was it Altruistic?

*altruistic - showing a disinterested and selfless concern for the well-being of others; unselfish*

Although, it may be true Mayor McIlroy is not in it for the money, that’s possible because the mayor retired from a long professional career before becoming mayor, and we can assume is receiving income from that retirement. An extra $40k on top of retirement income is a nice bonus, but most CEO’s of $20 million per year companies would never consider a leadership position with a pay of $40k per year. It’s been argued that is part time salary; however, it was reported that the current mayor regularly works 40-60 hours in that part time role.

If the city wants to open up the mayor role to non-retiree, professional leadership, it makes sense to increase the Mayor’s salary to be more competitive with the private sector.

As an incumbent retiree Mayor who doesn't need the money, it is not in the Mayor’s interest to attract competition to his elected position by raising the mayor's salary. While his opposition to the increase is easy to pass off as altruistic, his opposition to the raise also serves his own agenda to stay in office and to limit the field of competition to other retirees or candidates that aren't already professional leaders.
