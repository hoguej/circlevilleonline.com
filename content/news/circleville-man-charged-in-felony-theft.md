CIRCLEVILLE - A Circleville man appeared in Circleville Municipal Court yesterday on a summons for a felony theft charge. Joshua Peters is the former treasurer of Circleville Girls Softball League Inc, and he's being accused of taking $8,882.75 between April 26, 2018 and April 22, 2019 over 45 bank card transactions.

According to the police report, the investigation began when a former league member complained that there were irregularities in the league's finances. Mellissa Manson, a former league member, reported the league had $13,191 in income in 2017, but none was reported to the State of Ohio.

According to the probable cause affidavit, board member Anothony Miller advised the police investigator that he'd been a board member of the non-profit for a year and never had access to any financial statements. Miller reported that the league does parking for Pumpkin Show and recieves substantial income from that fundraiser.

The police investigation showed that questionable transactions against the account included, a hotel room, cable bill payments, electric payments, loan payments to bank, car insurance payments, cell phone payments, local restaurant tabs, rental cars, rent-to-own payments, ATM withdrawls and grocery purchases.

As a result of the irregularities, a freeze was placed on the checking and savings account on May 7. According to the report, a day later league president Scott Gaskins contacted the police department to find out why the account was froze. Gaskins said the league was aware of the issues, and that the transactions were on Peters's card. He told the investigator that the league intended to handle the matter internally and had made arrangements for Peters to pay back the league.

Peters allegedly sent an apology letter to the league, according to documents filed with the court. In the letter, Peters claimed it was a case of accidently using the wrong card. In court, Peters appeared heartbroken when Judge Dumm told him that he was to not have contact with the league until the issue was resolved. Peters was a softball coach in the league.

Several board members spoke to us on the condition of anonymity. They said that they have little or no access to information, such as meeting notifications, meeting minutes, financial information, or even the league's by-laws. According to board member Miller, when he asked for more details on the league's business, he was asked to resign from the board.

Peters was granted a recognizance bond, but was required to be booked and photographed at the Pickaway County Sheriff's Office.

Requests for comment from Joshua Peters and Scott Gaskins where not answered by the time of this article's publishing.
