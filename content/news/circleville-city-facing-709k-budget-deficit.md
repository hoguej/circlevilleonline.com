CIRCLEVILLE - Circleville City is projected to be $709,000 short of its budget for 2019 and must make cuts by April 1st to be compliant with State law. The shortage includes a $459,000 shortage in the safety fund and $250,000 in the general fund. The City’s administration has made a recommendation to cut funding for two police officer positions, half of a firefighter, and the volunteer firefighter positions. All departments in the city are reducing expenses to cut a total of $342,000. The budget issue will be discussed at the March 5th financial committee hearing, and a recommendation from that committee will be made to the council on March 19th.

It was previously reported that the city cashed in an investment to prop up the operating fund. Gayle Spangler, the Circleville Auditor, says the city cashed in a $300,000 certificate of deposit in order to make sure there was enough cash for all the city’s projected obligations coming out of the general fund. Spangler explained that each fund is made up of cash and investments component. In order to earn maximum interest from investments, the City wants to keep as much of its funds in investments as possible. The investment wasn’t pulled from another funder or reserve; it was just converted from the interest earning investment part of the fund to the spendable cash for upcoming expenses such as payroll. Spangler says the CD would have been fully mature in April, and  “The City didn’t pay any penalty on the cashing of the CD.”

Spangler clarified that the City always spends the most in the 4th quarter because it pays a lot of it’s expenses on an annual basis. For example, safety force paid time off is credited annually, and other expenses such as insurance and some utility expenses are 1-time annual payments. Revenue, on the other hand, comes more steadily throughout the year. The city operates a $19.9 million annual budget and currently has $9 million in investments. Spangler says that this is not a reserve, and all the money has been budgeted and allocated for 2019 expenses. In fact, she says the City does not operate with a reserve.

Last August, it was announced that the city would have to pay over a million dollars in damages to a former firefighter as a result of losing a harassment and discrimination lawsuit. Spangler said that all except a $35,000 deductible was paid by insurance. The deductible came out of the safety fund and isn’t a significant factor in the City’s budget shortfall. The City’s insurance rate did go up between 2018 and 2019, but Spangler says it’s hard to tell how much of that was because of the claim made and how much was from including new vehicles and appreciation. The 2018 auto, liability, and property insurance cost was $105,000. In 2019, the city paid $131,000 after competitively pricing the policy. Spangler adds that the 2018 insurer did submit a bid on the 2019 insurance contract, even after the large claim.

With $342,000 in budget cuts being discussed, how can the city consider a $300,000 expansion to Barthelmas Park? Spangler says the majority of the park expenses will come from the County, State, or other funding. In 2017, Pickaway County voters approved a park levy which raises $700,000 annually for the Pickaway County Parks District. Part of that funding is earmarked for grants to be distributed to cities, villages, and townships in the County. Spangler says that, “Land becoming available next to existing parks is very rare, and when the opportunity arises, cities try really hard to seize the opportunity. Parks are usually land locked.” Spangler says that the city will likely have to pay a small portion of the purchase price in matching funds, but it will come out of the Roads and Parks fund which cannot be used to shore up the general or safety fund any way.

Spangler says that the city has lost a lot of revenue due to taxes that were cut by State law changes starting in 2017. Since then, the State has also eliminated the inheritance tax and personal property tax. Personal property taxes went against mostly equipment and manufacturing. Spangler says, “The combination of these tax cuts reduced city revenue by $750,000 annually. It would take 3 Sofidel-sized projects to recoup that.” She also adds that in recent years, she’s been happy to see that City has been able to remain steady financially, despite all the hits to revenue. Spangler adds, “Local citizens supported a .4% income tax to go specifically to streets and parks and recreation. In the last two years the City has put over a $1 million in streets each year.”

Spangler says that Governor DeWine has indicated that he intends to increase funding to Cities from State funds, and that could help with future City budgets. However, she says it’s unclear if, when, and how much that will be.

This past week, DeWine requested an 18 cent per gallon increase in the gas tax. Spangler says, “The City expects to receive about $650k from the existing gas tax, and that pays for a lot of the existing street crews.” Spangler notes that gas tax income doesn’t go into the general fund, and a lot of the income is allocated for specific roads, like state routes. Fortunately, many of of Circleville’s main roads are also state routes.

We’ll keep you updated as the City navigates the budget for the looming April 1 timeline.
