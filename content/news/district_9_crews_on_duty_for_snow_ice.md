ODOT District 9 crews are on duty today, March 3, to patrol and treat the state highway system for snow and ice.

Snowplow operators in Adams, Brown, Highland, Pike and Ross counties are working this evening to patrol routes and apply de-icers as needed. Although total snow accumulation should be light, any additional snow that does fall will stick to wet pavement, and there is the potential for ice to form. 

Motorists are reminded of the need for additional caution. Routes that are lightly snow covered or clear and wet may be slick, so drivers should reduce their speed and allow additional travel time.

Drivers are also asked to give the plow drivers room to work. Remember: Don't Crowd the Plow!
