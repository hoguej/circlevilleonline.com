It's been a volatile week for Sonic of Circleville. Last Friday, February 22, [we reported](/news/sonics-close-unexpectedly-in-lancaster-circleville-and-grove-city/) that Circleville Sonic employees quit their jobs and shutdown the store for the weekend due to a labor dispute with the new ownership. Yesterday, reports were circulating on social media that Sonic in Circleville had been shut down yesterday by the health department. Although, the restaurant was closed over the weekend due to the employee walk out, according to Sam Neill, Emergency Response Coordinator at the Pickaway County General Health District, there was never a serious issue with their health and food safety inspection.

Neill says, “What happened was our Sanitarian was at the facility doing a change of ownership inspection. This means our staff just did a walk-through looking at basic sanitation at the facility. While our sanitarian was at the facility one of the equipment malfunctioned and the Sonic owner decided to voluntarily close the store because of the employees safety. At no point did our sanitarian close the facility down because of health code violations. There were minor problems found, and they have 30 days to resolve those minor problems. The report that our sanitarian did on the restaurant was just a basic walk-through. Our sanitarian will go back within 30 days to do a complete follow-up and if they don’t get the minor problems resolved it will be a health code violation.”

Here is the copy of the change of ownership inspection report from the Pickaway County General Health District. They show minor maintenance issues, with a follow-up inspection in 30 days.
