CIRCLEVILLE - Kindergarten registration for the 2019-2020 school year will take place April 8th-11th on campus by appointment only at 740-474-4340. Circleville City Schools administrative staff will be on site at PICCA Head Start of Circleville March 13th-14th.
 
 Once again this year we will be hosting our "Kindergarten Signing Day" photo-op sessions along with registration. Be sure to bring your child for the chance at a keepsake photo as you and your family sign your Tiger up to join our team at Circleville City Schools!
