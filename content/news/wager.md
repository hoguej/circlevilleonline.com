Clean Screen Productions, a locally owned production company in Ohio, is producing the award winning screenplay "The Wager," in Pickaway County.

# What's the film about?
The Wager encompasses the brevity of the life of a man named Bruce, with just about as much hardship that could possibly be encumbered on any one person. And Bruce messed up just about as much as anyone could, in fact he had done some very very bad things. But, that all comes to an abrupt end when Bruce loses the wager and is thrust back in time to see his life, and the heinous acts he did,  but from the perspective and eyes of those he brutally hurt. A Journey that will forever alter broken life.

# Why are you fundraising?
Jim Gloyd, the film's producer says, "We are all incredibly passionate about this film, and even more committed to making sure it is equipped with everything it needs to be done right."

# Why this movie?
Gloyd says, there is a lot of excitement behind this movie and the impact it will make on communities. Though it is not the central theme, The Wager targets the opioid crisis in Ohio. At least 4,149 Ohioans died from unintentional drug overdoses in 2016, a 36 percent leap from just the previous year, when Ohio had by far the most overdose by deaths in the nation, according to figures from county coroners. This trend has continued to climb where it is now projected that Ohio leads the nation in opioid related deaths. Gloyd adds, "This film will impact Ohio and abroad!"

# Fundraising Details
Gloyd concludes, "We had people in seven states invest in it when we were looking for investors. We would really like to see Pickaway County get behind it now that we are in a crowdfunding phase."
