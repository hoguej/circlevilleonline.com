In the next installment of the Sonic saga, ownership of the Circleville Sonic Restaurant have posted their own hand-written note to their customers. This is in response to a note left yesterday after employees decided to get up and walk out, leaving the store closed for the night.

[We reported last night that the Circleville, Lancaster, and Grove City locations were also closed with notes at some of the locations from the employees.](https://www.circlevilleonline.com/sonics-close-unexpectedly-in-lancaster-circleville-and-grove-city)

A Washington Courthouse Sonic location opened just a few weeks ago. A mother of two of the employees reports problems from that location as well. Carmen Dennen posted to an area Facebook group that her daughter was shorted 20+ hours and her son was shorted 14 hours on their last check. She says her children were told that the store didn't have the money to pay the whole check.

Sonic's ownership reply posted at the Circleville location:
Sonic Customers,

> We are truly grateful for your loyalty to this company. We have got to know each and every one of you. You all are the reason this company kept us going daily. We appreciate you all! No, we are not closing for good! A new company has took over and the old crew had decided to move on. We hope you will support them as if it were the old team. Once again, thank you all for everything. New crew will be coming Soon.
> Love Sonic team
