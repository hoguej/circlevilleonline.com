As [reported earlier](/news/circleville-city-facing-709k-budget-deficit), Circleville City is facing a large budget deficit. Tonight, there will be a short (no ordinances scheduled for reading) City Council meeting at 7 PM followed by a not-so-short Finance Committee meeting at 7:15 PM. One of the topics of discussion is a 0.5% income tax increase to be considered for the Fall ballot. The Committee is expected to send the tax proposal and budget cuts to the next council meeting. The budget adjustments, which include staff reduction, are expected to impact the City's administration, police department, and fire department.

The officially communicated agenda for tonight's meeting:
